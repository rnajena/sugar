This project aims to provide a lightweight framework for bioinformatics.
Functionality will be added as needed.
WIP - work in progress.

In the meantime, you can check out this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rnajena/sugar/blob/master/assets/sugar_tutorial.ipynb) to see what can be done with sugar.

### Installation

Use pip, e.g.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/rnajena/sugar.git
```

All dependencies are optional. To get a minimal install use the `--no-deps` flag of pip.
Run tests with `sugar test` (needs pytest).
