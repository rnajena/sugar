sugar documentation
===================

Welcome to sugar's documentation!

The sugar project aims to provide a lightweight framework
to facilitate rapid application development for bioinformatics.

It thus provides classes and functions for working with DNA and RNA sequences,
as well as related annotations,
and it provides parsers and writers for various file formats using a plugin interface.
