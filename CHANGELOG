    - add BioBasket.merge method to merge sequences of the same id into a single sequence
    - add BioBasket.plot_alignment method
    - add BioSeq.slindex method
    - add update_fts option to translate
    - switch default value of inplace option to False for filter methods
  * io:
    - writers: allow to pass None as fname, in this case a string will be returned

    - add TSV/CSV IO support for features
    - add SJSON IO support for features (custom lossless file format), add private option to write private metadata
    - add the possibility to read GFF files for old format versions
    - allow to write compressed files just by specifying the filename extension
    - add a sugar header comment for some writers (stockholm, gff, gtf)
    - glob expressions in file names are now evaluated in sorted order
    - remove the tool option for reading and writing, use the new to/from methods instead
  * scripts:
    - rename convert and convertf commands to cat and catf, respectively, also accept multiple files as input
    - add merge command to merge sequence files
  * index: rename get method to get_basket, add get_seq method
  * add imaging module with plot_alignment function
  * substantially improve the documentation

    - BioSeq.match: rename orf option to rf, allow tuple-like arguments
    - consequently rename BioSeq.meta.features to BioSeq.meta.fts
    - add BioBasket.fts attribute, add add_fts method for BioSeq and BioBasket
    - move all str methods to BioSeq.str and BioBasket.str namespace
    - new class LocationTuple used internally for Feature.locs
    - introduce BioSeq.sl and BioBasket.sl methods and options for slices
      (gap, inplace, update_fts)
    - refactor Defect code
